I lead Developer Relations at Inference.net and am obsessed with DX, growth, and virality.

I grew [smry.ai](https://smry.ai) to 1M visitors/mo, and spend my free time thinking about applications of small language models, consumer apps, devtools, and currently b2b/GTM strategies. This blog is partly to share my thoughts with the world, but more importantly to focus them.

Previously I educated developers on information retrieval and AI engineering at KX.
